## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Fetch API

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced writing more modular and reusable Javascript code by creating a simple HttpService class.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:
- Experiment more with advanced CSS animations and transitions for better user experience.
- Write more reusable utility services.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch - This helped me for fetching API using javascript. It is easy to understand and provides quick solutions.
- [Digital Ocean] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data - This gives an another aspect of using fetch API to get data. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Axios] https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro - It helped me understand the structure of the axios get method and the method in my project was shaped accordingly.
